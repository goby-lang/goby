Goby is a Ruby-like object oriented language written in Go. And it's **not** a new Ruby implementation. Instead, it should be a language that help developer create api server or microservice efficiently.

It will have Ruby's syntax (I'll try to support all common syntaxes) but without most of Ruby's meta-programming magic to make the VM simple. It will also have built in http library that is built upon Go's efficient http package. And I'm planning to do more optimization by using goroutine directly.

## Questions

A lot people have questions about `goby` since it's a new language and you may get confused by the way I describe it (sorry for that 😢). Here's a list of [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions).

- **Can evaluate bytecode directly**
- Everything is object
- Support comment 
- Object and Class
    - Top level main object
    - Constructor
    - Support class method
    - Support inheritance
    - Support instance variable
    - Support self
- Variables
    - Constant
    - Local variable
    - Instance variable

    - Class
    - Integer
    - String
    - Boolean
    - nil
    - Hash
    - Array
- Flow control
    - If statement

    - `ARGV`
    
**(You can open an issue for any feature request)**

## Something different from Ruby

#### Method call syntax
For now, all method call needs to use parentheses to wrap their arguments. Including methods like `require`, `include` which we normally won't do this.

It'll look like:

```ruby
require("foo")

class Bar
  include(Foo)
end
```

There's two reason for this:

##### I want to make Goby's syntax more consistent than Ruby
In Ruby you can write most of things in many different ways, and that can cause some confusion so we need style guide(s) to tell programmers write code consistently.

But in some programming languages like go, the syntax is very limited which in sometimes is very verbose, but this also makes program more easy to understand and maintain.

##### This requires a parser generator

Since our parser is handcrafted, supporting this feature would be hard and can easily cause bugs on some edge cases.

Although we definitely will replace current parser with a parser generator, this is not our top priority now.


**If you have any thought on this, please join our discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/issues/84). We would love to hear some user's feedback 😁**


## TODO & WIP

Checkout this [issue](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/issues/72) for what we will work on before first release.

Also see [huboard](https://huboard.com/goby-lang/goby)

## Install

1. You must have Golang installed
2. You must have set $GOPATH
3. Add your $GOPATH/bin into $PATH
4. Run following command 

```
$ go get github.com/goby-lang/goby
```

## Usage

**Execute goby file using VM**

(might see errors on sample-6 since vm hasn't support block yet)

``` 
$ goby ./samples/sample-1.ro
#=> 16
```

**Compile goby code**

```
$ goby -c ./samples/sample-1.ro
```

You'll see `sample-1.robc` in `./samples`

**Execute bytecode**

```
$ goby ./samples/sample-1.robc
```

## Try it!

(See sample directory)

```
$ goby ./samples/sample-1.ro
$ goby ./samples/sample-2.ro
$ goby ./samples/sample-3.ro
$ goby ./samples/sample-4.ro
$ goby .....
```

##  Sample snippet.

```ruby
class User
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def age
    @age
  end

  def say_hi(user)
    puts(@name + " says hi to " + user.name)
  end

  def self.sum_age(user1, user2)
    user1.age + user2.age
  end
end

stan = User.new("Stan", 22)
john = User.new("John", 40)
puts(User.sum_age(stan, john)) #=> 62
stan.say_hi(john) #=> Stan says hi to John
```

#### Build a stack using goby

```ruby
class Stack
  def initialize
    @data = []
  end
    
  def push(x)
    @data.push(x)
  end
    
  def pop
    @data.pop
  end
    
  def top
    @data[@data.length - 1]
  end
end

s = Stack.new
s.push(1)
s.push(2)
s.push(3)
s.push(4)
s.push(10)
puts(s.pop) #=> 10
puts(s.top) #=> 4
```

#### Block support

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize
    yield(self)
  end
  
  def color=(c)
    @color = c
  end
  
  def color
    @color
  end
  
  def doors=(ds)
    @doors = ds
  end
  
  def doors
    @doors
  end
end
 
car = Car.new do |c|
  c.color = "Red"
  c.doors = 4
end
 
puts("My car's color is " + car.color + " and it's got " + car.doors.to_s + " doors.")

```
