Goby is an object-oriented interpreter language deeply inspired by Ruby and written in 100% pure Go. The goal of Goby is to help web developers create api servers or microservices simply and efficiently, with a help of tough thread-mechanism from Go's goroutine, see the [thread's example](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/one_thousand_threads.gb). Howerver, We do not intend to reproduce all of works in Ruby implementation.

Goby will finally equip a reduced set of Ruby's fundamental syntax, including Ruby's common methods and libraries, but will not equip most of Ruby's meta-programming magic to make Goby VM simpler. Goby will also finally equip a built-in HTTP library and multi-threaded server that comes from Go's HTTP packages.

Goby interpreter is a monolithic binary executable, which consists of a YARV-like VM and a compiler, and a REPL (which is better than `irb`!). All components of Goby compiler, such as AST, lexer, parser, token, are written in 100% pure Go, instead of using conventional static yacc/lex/bison conversion. Goby maintainers don't need to care about C language anymore!

We are optimizing and expanding Goby all the time and need your help. One of our vision is to utilize and manages tons of Go's packages easily from Goby scripts. Currently we already have some progress, see the introduction of Goby's [Plugin System](https://goby-lang.gitbooks.io/goby/content/chapter1.html)

## Install

### From Source

1. You must have Golang installed
2. You must have set $GOPATH
3. Add your $GOPATH/bin into $PATH
4. Run following command 

    ```
    $ go get github.com/goby-lang/goby
    ```
5. Set `GOBY_ROOT` to the project's root path, which should be:

    ```
    $GOPATH/src/github.com/goby-lang/goby
    ```

### Via Homebrew

**Please checkout the [latest release](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/releases) before using this approach**

```
brew tap goby-lang/goby
brew install goby
```

### Verify Your Installation

1. Run `goby -v` to see the version.
2. Run `goby -i` to enter interactive console.
3. Type `require "file"`.
4. If no error shows up than you have successfully installed Goby :)
5. You can also just run `brew test goby` if you install it via homebrew.

**If you have any issue installing Goby, please open an issue for it**

## Usage

**Execute goby file:**
```
$ goby ./samples/server.gb
```

**Run interactive console:**
```
$ goby -i
```

## Samples

See [sample directory](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/tree/master/samples) for sample code snippets, like:

- [Built a stack data structure using Goby](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/stack.gb)
- [Running a "Hello World" app with built in server library](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/server/server.gb)
- [Sending request using http library](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/http.gb)
- [Running load test on blocking server](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/server/blocking_server.gb) (This shows `Goby`'s simple server is very performant and can handle requests concurrently)
- [One thousand threads](https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/blob/master/samples/one_thousand_threads.gb)
